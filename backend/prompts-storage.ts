Each question should be an object with the following structure:
"question": a clear and technically correct question

"answers": an array of 3 plausible answer choices (strings)

"correct": the exact correct answer (must match one of the options in "answers")

Return the output as a JSON array (no variable name, no explanation).
Ensure no duplicate questions, and avoid trivial or overly basic ones.

example:

    "answers": ["JSON.parse()", "JSON.stringify()", "parseJSON()", "decodeJSON()"],
    "correct": "JSON.parse()"
